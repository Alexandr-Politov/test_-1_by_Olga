Your task is to develop a simple Product Management System using FastAPI, SQLalchemy, Alembic, and Pydantic. Feel free to add other technologies if you will. Requirements:

Model: Create a Product model with fields id, name, description, price, and created_at. The id should be the primary key.
API Endpoints:

Create Product: Create an API endpoint /products/ (POST request) that receives a product's name, description and price in JSON format and stores it in the database.
Get Product: Create an API endpoint /products/{id} (GET request) that retrieves a product based on the id.
Update Product: Create an API endpoint /products/{id} (PUT request) that updates a product's name, description or price based on the id.
Delete Product: Create an API endpoint /products/{id} (DELETE request) that deletes a product based on the id.


Database: Use SQLalchemy ORM to manage database operations.
Migrations: Use Alembic for database migration. Make sure to create a new database revision file every time the Product model changes.
Validation: Use Pydantic for data validation. Validate the name, description, and price for proper format. Shoul contain:


A repository containing all the code.
A README.md file explaining how to run the application and API usage.
Postman collection or CURL commands to test the API. Additional tasks for extra points:
Implement a basic inventory management feature (i.e., track the quantity of each product).
Implement a simple product category classification (i.e., each product can belong to a category).
Write unit tests for your API endpoints. Remember, while the completion of the task is important, we also want to see good software engineering practices. Keep in mind principles like DRY, SOLID.
